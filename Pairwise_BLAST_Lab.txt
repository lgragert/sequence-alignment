INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING BLAST WEB TOOL

###############################################################################


Mammalian genome has abundant transposable elements (TE) that consist of DNA 
transposons and retrotransposons. Retrotransposons are a subclass that mobilize
through RNA intermediates. They closely resemble and hence may be derived from 
retrovirus. The high density of TE in human genome may be suggestive of 
evolutionary significance with a vital role in normal physiology as well as 
pathogenesis. A recent study showed that LINE-1 retroelements in neurons alter
brain development.

One such example of retrotransposons has potential neurological significance. 
Synaptic plasticity of neurons governs the learning and adaptive capability of
the brain and this is reported to be hampered in disorders like Alzheimer's 
disease, schizophrenia etc. The Arc gene that encodes Activity Regulated 
Cytoskeleton Associated Protein is essential for synaptic plasticity. A recent 
study by Pastuzyn et al., indicates that Arc gene encodes a retrotransposon 
and has indicated it's similarity with a retroviral protein.

In this exercise we will find out if there is any homology of this 
retrotransposon with retroviruses.

Open the blast home page at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

Select on the Nucleotide BLAST page and then either paste the ARC nucleotide 
fasta sequence (file provided) or enter the accession number or upload the 
FASTA file (provided)

Give your submission job a title, select a database (nr/nt is default or 
choose refSeq representative genomes), run BLAST

To run the BLAST only for viruses or retroviruses type "Viruses" or 
Retro-transcribing viruses" in Organism column

Are there any viral nucleotide sequences that show homology to ARC 
nucleotide sequence?

Run BLAST and try changing the Expect threshold and Max target sequences 
etc. to see changes in the output of similar results

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING BIOPYTHON BLAST SCRIPT
###############################################################################

Biopython is an open source python tool that has classes and modules that can 
be used for bioinformatics tasks. BLAST can be run locally using NCBI 
standalone BLAST tool.

Biopython offers a better deal as it runs the BLAST and gets the output, as 
well as parses the BLAST output for further analysis.

# Open terminal (iTerm/Cygwin) and change to working directory where you downloaded 
# all the scripts
chmod 775 *sh

# Installs BLAST and makes viral protein DB

# Mac
bash blast_setup_mac.sh
# Windows
bash blast_setup_windows.sh

# Runs NCBI local blast of ARC protein sequence and Viral proteome to give blast 
# output as BLAST_output.txt
bash blast_local_run.sh 

# Runs NCBI BLAST by bipython of ARC protein sequence and Viral proteome to give 
# blast output as blast_output.xml
python3 biopython_blast.py 

# Parses the XML file and gets the output in BLAST_results.csv
python3 blast_output_parser.py
