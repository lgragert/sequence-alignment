# Chocolatey package manager (https://chocolatey.org/)
# Package managers allow users to install and update software from the command line

# Open an admin Powershell Window - right-click Run As Administrator 

# Powershell can be "Run As Administrator" by default by doing the following:
# 1) Search Powershell from Windows Explorer (or Cortana if using Windows 10 and pin to taskbar)
# 2) After pinning to taskbar, right-click the Powershell icon on the taskbar
# 3) Right-click again on the "Windows Powershell" option from the drop down menu and left-click "Properties"
# 4) Under "Shortcut tab" left-click "Advanced..." button"
# 5) Make sure the box next to "Run As Administrator" is checked and then click "Apply"

# Copy the following commands inside backticks ``` and paste in Powershell (and later Cygwin terminal)
# Use WordPad to open this text file to start - until you have Visual Studio Code installed.

# Download all scripts and files from Canvas to working directory

# On your Windows filesystem, you should have a C:\tools\cygwin\home\<username> folder.
# In Cygwin, the same directory is /home/<username>/.
# This home directory is good place to put all your files.
# You can create a /dev/sequence-alignment subdirectory in your home.

# From Cygwin, you can access other directories on your hard cygdrive.
# The /cygdrive/c/ folder on Cygwin is the same as C:\ in Windows filesystem.

# Also set Visual Studio Code to be the default editor for .txt,.sh, and .py files in Windows.
# Right-click on file in Explorer to select which program to use to open a file.
# You can also type "code <filename>" in Cygwin to open a file.

# Command to update all packages managed by Chocolatey

# Run every few weeks or so to keep software up to date.
# Won't do anything until updated packages are available.

```
