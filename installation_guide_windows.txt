WINDOWS SOFTWARE INSTALLATION GUIDE

#####################################################################################################

* Chocolatey package manager (https://chocolatey.org/) - Package managers allow users to install and update software from the command line

Open an admin Powershell Window - right-click Run As Administrator -Powershell can be "Run As Administrator" by default by doing the following:
1) Search Powershell from Windows Explorer (or Cortana if using Windows 10 and pin to taskbar)
2) After pinning to taskbar, right-click the Powershell icon on the taskbar
3) Right-click again on the "Windows Powershell" option from the drop down menu and left-click "Properties"
4) Under "Shortcut tab" left-click "Advanced..." button"
# 5) Make sure the box next to "Run As Administrator" is checked and then click "Apply"

Copy commands inside backticks and paste in Powershell (and later Cygwin terminal)
Use WordPad to open this text file to start - until you have Atom installed.

choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation
```

* Cygwin - Unix Terminal / Bash Shell Functionality

```
choco install cygwin
```

* Curl - Unix Command line tool for transferring data

Install lynx using Powershell:

```
cd C:\tools\cygwin\
./cygwinsetup.exe -q -P wget,tar,qawk,bzip2,vim,lynx
```

Install apt-cyg and curl using Cygwin Terminal (apt-cyg is package manager for Cygwin)
Use Cygwin terminal from here on - Powershell is for Windows, Cygwin is for Unix.
```
lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
install apt-cyg /bin
apt-cyg install curl
```

* Atom - Text Editor

```
choco install atom
```

* Python3

```
choco install python3
```

* Biopython - Install if not already using Python Anaconda distribution

# Pip is the package manager for Python modules

```
pip3 install biopython
```

* PuTTY - SSH - Needed to connect to Cypress

```
choco install putty
```

* R and RStudio

```
choco install r.project
choco install r.studio
```

* PyCharm IDE for Python

```
choco install pycharm
```

* Download all scripts and files from Canvas to working directory

On your Windows filesystem, you should have a C:\tools\cygwin\home\<username> folder.
In Cygwin, the same directory is /home/<username>/.
This home directory is good place to put all your files.
You can create a /dev/sequence-alignment subdirectory in your home.

From Cygwin, you can access other directories on your hard cygdrive.
The /cygdrive/c/ folder on Cygwin is the same as C:\ in Windows filesystem.

Also set Atom to be the default editor for .txt,.sh, and .py files in Windows.
Right-click on file in Explorer to select which program to use to open a file.
You can also type "atom <filename>" in Cygwin to open a file.

* Command to update all packages managed by Chocolatey

Run every few weeks or so to keep software up to date.
Won't do anything until updated packages are available.

```
choco upgrade all
```

# Can also choose a specific package to update - See all commands here
# https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsUpgrade
